# Hi there, I'm Rizkyani Indah Lestari - a.k.a [rzkyndhlstr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rizkyani-indah-lestari/) ðŸ‘‹
## About me
I have experience as a Data Entry and Admin for approximately 2 year with an ability to typing speed at 53â€“57 WPM and an accuracy of 80â€“90 percent. I am a detail-oriented person, well-organized and multitasking.

I am seeking for work right now and am interested in Administrative, Data Entry, and Customer Service position. However, it is possible to get opportunities in other positions. As a young generation, I have high enthusiasm and curiosity. I am responsible, honest, and willing to learn new skills and expand my knowledge and abilities. With the skills and experience that I have, I am ready to join and contribute to your company.

I am also interested about Front-end Development. Therefore as a solution, in my spare time, I am learning Frontend with a computer language, which includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

On this github, you can see the outcomes of an exercise I completed with [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) as a guide.

If you are interested in contacting me in regards to a position with your company, please email me at irizkyani@gmail.com , or feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rizkyani-indah-lestari/).
